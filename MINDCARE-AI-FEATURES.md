### 4. **AI-Powered Thought Reframing**

**Intelligent Pattern Recognition:**
Automatically detects cognitive distortions in your thoughts:

- **Fixed mindset**: "I can't do this" → "I haven't mastered this yet"
- **Rigid expectations**: "I should be better" → "I could choose to improve"

**How It Works:**

2. AI analyzes the thought pattern using CBT principles
3. Generates a healthier reframe instantly
4. Provides a personalized tip on why this reframe works

**Example:**
- **Input**: "I can't handle stress"
- **AI Reframe**: "What if: I haven't yet learned all the stress management techniques that would work for me"
- **Tip**: "Fixed mindset detected. Try adopting a growth mindset - challenges are opportunities to learn."
